  "2": "Welcome to the Help Menu for the loading bar function.\nHere you can find a short description on how to use it.\n\nIf the user wants to keep track of the simulation state, a loading bar is imported in this library. The loading bar is not part of the class, so you don't need to call it like a class.\n\nUsage:\nloadingBar(count, total)\n    count - is your loop variable\n    total - is the length of the variables that will be sweeped.\n\nExample:\nfrom Constructor import loadingBar\nfor i in range(10):\n    loadingBar(i, 10)",
  "3": "Welcome to the Help Menu for creating simulation log File from Lumerical.\n\nWhen you load the Logfile function from the Constructor Library, the user can keep track of the simulation and parameters used. To use the log File you need to give a list with two dictionaries. The first can be the dictionary with Parameters given for the simulation like 'Taper Width', 'WG Width'... The second dictionary can be called directly after performing an analysis with obj.ReturnLogInfo(). This will extract the object that you simulated and the solver that you used. A text file will be created in the given Path. The name of the File will be 'Lumerical_Simulation_Log_15_10_52'.\n\nAn example can be seen here:\n\nfrom Constructor import Logfile\nPath = 'C:/Downloads/'\nsolverInfo = obj.ReturnLogInfo()\ndata = [solverInfo, Parameters]\nLogfile(data, Path)"
